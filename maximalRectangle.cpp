If you think this algorithm is not easy to understand, you can try this example:

0 0 0 1 0 0 0 
0 0 1 1 1 0 0 
0 1 1 1 1 1 0
The vector "left" and "right" from row 0 to row 2 are as follows

row 0:

l: 0 0 0 3 0 0 0
r: 7 7 7 4 7 7 7
row 1:

l: 0 0 2 3 2 0 0
r: 7 7 5 4 5 7 7 
row 2:

l: 0 1 2 3 2 1 0
r: 7 6 5 4 5 6 7
The vector "left" is computing the left boundary. Take (i,j)=(1,3) for example. On current row 1, the left boundary is at j=2. However, because matrix[1][3] is 1, you need to consider the left boundary on previous row as well, which is 3. So the real left boundary at (1,3) is 3.

I hope this additional explanation makes things clearer. */
